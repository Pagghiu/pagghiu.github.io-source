<h2>SC::Tools<a href="#section-1" id="section-1" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>
<p class="chapter">written for Sane C++ Libraries, using Sane C++ Libraries</p>
<p>
There is no better way to improve a library than using it to create some other project or tool.
<br>
This is why effort has been spent using Sane C++ Libraries to build some useful tools
needed by...Sane C++ Libraries!
</p>

<p>
So, unsurprisingly, the big addition of the month to Sane C++ Libraries are <a
href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/page_tools.html" target="_blank">SC::Tools</a>!
</p>
<p>

Something similar to <a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/page_tools.html"
target="_blank">SC::Tools</a> already used to exist in some form:
<code>SCBuild.cpp</code>, the bootstrap from source C++ file using
<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_build.html" target="_blank">SC::Build</a>
build system (generator).<br>
It used to work thanks to a bootstrap bash / batch file that compiles <code>SC-Build.cpp</code> and
the unity build file <code>SC.cpp</code> to produce the <code>SCBuild[.exe]</code> self-contained
(statically linked) executable.<br>
This was nice but it had a few issues, for example it was not able to detect
changes in any of the source files and rebuild the executable accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/page_tools.html" target="_blank">SC::Tools</a>
is a generalization of the
<code>SCBuild.{sh | bat} </code> mechanism into a more flexible
<code>SC.sh $TOOL [$ACTION]</code>.

This allows also running custom tools, leveraging Sane C++ Libraries, by just launching
<code>SC.sh myDirectory/myScript.cpp [$ACTION]</code>!
</p>
<p>
<a href="{attach}/images/2024-03-27-SaneCppLibrariesUpdate/tool.png" target="_blank">
<img src="{attach}/images/2024-03-27-SaneCppLibrariesUpdate/tool.png">
</a>
</p>

<p>
The source code dependency tracking is taken care of by a couple of parametric makefiles.<br>

The intermediate files directory is shared by all tools, and the unity build file
<code>SC.cpp</code> (#include-d by <code>Tools.cpp</code> ) makes the entire set of Sane C++
Libraries available to every tool.<br>
It's compiled just once (in a couple of seconds), making any successive compile / linking of
the tools extremely fast (less than 1 sec on a recent laptop).
</p>
<p>
Tools in the<code>Tools</code> subdirectory are special, as they can be invoked by just using
their name (without the <code>SC-</code> prefix).<br>
<code>./SC.sh Tools/SC-build.cpp</code> can be invoked as just <code>./SC.sh build</code>.
</p>
</section>



<section>
<h2>SC-build.cpp<a href="#section-2" id="section-2" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>
<p class="chapter">building C++ programs in C++, why not?</p>
The first tool is just called
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-build.cpp" target="_blank">
SC-build.cpp</a>.<br> It comes with a companion
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-build.h" target="_blank">
SC-build.h</a> file holding code shared between multiple projects.<br>
Its default action (<code>configure</code>) is equivalent to
the (now old) <code>SCBuild.sh</code>, that generates build/project files.
<p>
The new action called <code>compile</code> (guess what?) compiles the
generated projects 🤯!
</p>
<p>
<code>./SC.sh Tools/SC-build.cpp configure</code><br>
or<br>
<code>./SC.sh build configure</code>
</p>
<p>
and on windows:
</p>

<p>
<code>SC.bat Tools\SC-build.cpp compile</code><br>
or<br>
<code>SC.bat build compile</code>
</p>

<section>
<h2>SC-package.cpp<a href="#section-3" id="section-3" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>
<p class="chapter">wheel reinvention, reinvented</p>
The second tool is
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-package.cpp" target="_blank">
SC-package.cpp</a>, once again a manifestation of the wheel
reinvention attitude already pervading the entire project 😊.
<p>
This poor-man's imperative package manager downloads binary files taking care of checking
MD5, extracting and testing what's contained.<br>
The guiding reason for this tool to exist was to automatically be able downloading and
extracting the official<code>clang</code> distribution (at a specific version, matching the
Gitlab CI) in order to use <code>clang-format</code> on the entire repo.<br>
This is needed for a potential contributor to properly format files before sending a Pull
Request, keeping the CI format validation jobs happy.
</p>

<p>
The end result is a folder with <i>_PackagesCache</i> and <i>_Packages</i> under <i>_Build</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is still very primitive for now, but who knows, maybe in the future it could be evolved
into something more advanced.
</p>

</p>
<h3>Additional reasons to exist<a href="#section-3-1" id="section-3-1" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p class="chapter">other than wheel re-invention</p>
<p>
Too often <i>repository automation</i> tools are written in<code>bash</code> or
<code>batch</code> where best thing you can do is putting print (echo) statements to debug
them.<br>
Slightly better are the cases when an actual programming language like <code>python</code>
or <code>javascript</code> is used, but sometimes this comes with an entire set of problems
regarding their requirements and in general the fact that such tools expect to be installed
globally on developer's system, with probability of incurring into a <i>it works on my machine</i>
situation.<br> Things like Python <i>.venv</i> can sometimes help but not always. <br>
In some cases such scripts do not even exist, but you're getting a bunch of <i>install this</i>
or <i>install that</i> <code>Readmes</code> always missing some step and where you end up
wasting a lot of time.<br>
And let's not discuss docker about please, I am trying to stay nice 😄.
</p>

<p>
So my obvious solution has been to write such a tool in C++ using Sane C++ Libraries of
course, so that I can debug it properly just like any other program.<br>
I am really happy the result, the small program is easy to follow and does its job.<br>
For now all data is local to the repository <i>_Build</i> directory but it would be easy
sharing the <i>_PackagesCache</i> into some custom user directory to save some space on
multiple checked-out copies of the repository. <br>
For any issue, I can just debug this C++ <i>shell script</i>, that is just a regular
<i>program</i>, like all other programs that a C++ programmer debugs <i>every day</i>.
</p>

<h3>Technical Details<a href="#section-3-2" id="section-3-2" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h3>
<p class="chapter">if you really want to know...</p>
<p>
On Posix to get<code>clang+llvm-x.y.z-$ARCH-$PLATFORM</code> you just download a file from
github, check it MD5, and extract the <code>.tar.gz</code> file.<br>
</p>
<p>

On Windows this is even more difficult because the official LLVM binary distribution is some
sort of self-extracting setup (requiring admin privileges too!) and to extract it you need a
tool like <code>7zip</code>.
<code>7zip</code> is as well a self extracting installer and requires another tool (called
<code>7zr.exe</code>) in order to be extracted!.
So on Windows <code>SC-package</code> downloads <code>7zr.exe</code> -> extracts the
<code>7zip</code> installer -> uses the extracted <code>7z.exe</code> to extract the
<code>LLVM-X.Y.Z-$ARCH</code> into some directory.
If someone knows an easier way of doing this (without installing other tools or requiring a
package manger) please let me know.
</p>

<p>
On all platforms / architectures (macOS/Windows/Linux and ARM64/Intel64) MD5 of the
downloaded files it's being checked to make sure they're all legit.
This also helps creating a <i>_PackagesCache</i> to hold these setup files and avoid
re-downloading them every time.
</p>

<p>
Also a small <code>clang-format</code> test is run to make sure it's properly installed and
available.
The extracted directory is symlinked into a <i>_Packages</i> sub-folder containing package name
/ platform.
</p>


<p>
Sane C++ Libraries doesn't have (yet) a properly working HTTPS client, so an alternative
solution was necessary.
It looks like nowadays<code>curl</code> is pre-installed on any
recent <code>macOS</code>,<code>linux</code> and<code>windows</code>
install and so <code>SC-package</code> uses it.
</p>


<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_hashing.html" target="_blank">SC::Hashing</a>
library has been used to compute all MD5 easily getting the job done.
<br>
File operations and cross-platform path handling have been implemented using the
<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_file_system.html" target="_blank">SC::FileSystem</a>
library.

</section>



<section>
<h2>SC-format.cpp<a href="#section-4" id="section-4" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>
<p class="chapter">code is poetry, prove me wrong</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-format.cpp" target="_blank">
SC-format.cpp
</a>
runs <code>clang-format</code> on all files of the repository, with some exclusions, to beautify source code.
<p>
It launches many parallel processes but always <i>dynamically limiting</i> them to the number
of available processors using <a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_process.html"
target="_blank">SC::Process</a>.
Processes are monitored using the
<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_async.html" target="_blank">SC::Async</a>
Library, and as soon as one "slot" is made available, it's being filled with a new <code>clang-format</code>
process.
</p>
<p>
Most code has upper bounds and fixed buffers.<br>
Even if it's totally unnecessary for such a small script, it's cool to see how the libraries work
together to allow minimal (or no) heap allocation!<br>
In this example the number of maximum processes is fixed and the recursive file system iteration
happens with a lambda, avoiding storing a vector of all file paths found in the target directory.
</p>
<p>
<a href="{attach}/images/2024-03-27-SaneCppLibrariesUpdate/format-script.png" target="_blank">
<img src="{attach}/images/2024-03-27-SaneCppLibrariesUpdate/format-script.png">
</a>
</p>

<p>

The tool looks for <code>clang-format</code> in known places, depending on platform, and if a
working <code>clang-format</code> at the correct version is found, it will be used.
This is for example what happens on CI as <code>clang-format</code> is pre-installed on Github
CI OS
Images.
If the no suitable <code>clang-format</code> has been found, then
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-format.cpp" target="_blank">
SC-format.cpp
</a>
relies on
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/blob/main/Tools/SC-package.cpp" target="_blank">
SC-package.cpp
</a>

to
download a brand new set of LLVM binaries from github, extracting and symlinking them.

<h3>Improvements to the CI and .vscode files<a href="#section-4-1" id="section-4-1" class="secondary"
tabindex="-1">#</a></h3>

All these tools are now making the CI scripts and the .VSCode files a lot nicer.
<p>
These are the new simplified CI and VSCode build scripts:

<section>
<h2>Improvements to the Library<a href="#section-5" id="section-5" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>

As expected, the act of building this simple set of tools, has uncovered issues, bugs and
limitations in Sane C++ Libraries.<br>
Of course they've been promptly fixed, but this shows, once again, that developing libraries
in a vacuum doesn't generate strong enough code 🙂.<br>
Hopefully more developers will start using the libraries, reporting issues or providing bug-reports
and maybe even Pull Requests!

<h3>SC::Process</h3>
The <a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_process.html" target="_blank">SC::Process</a>
class has been pretty crucial in implementing the tools.
<p>
The original interface was not so easy to use so it got a nice facelift:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/f038a44e67e9c72b88182c20cc923698512342b2"
target="_blank">
Process: Improve the API to be more pleasant to use</a>
</li>
</ul>

<img src="{attach}/images/2024-03-27-SaneCppLibrariesUpdate/new-process-api.png">
</a>

</p>
<p>
It also got some more features:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/bed597734acf9673427d3d61722854e2743c8b3b"
target="_blank">
Process: Allow ignoring child process standard output / error</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/32e5fb47ca022078a7a02cf131057342d2df5cfd"
target="_blank">
Process: Add Process::getNumberOfProcessors
</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Improved Tests and Documentation:
<ul>
<li>

target="_blank"> Process: Cleanup tests and improve documentation
</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
and bugfixes for very tricky OS-specific issues!
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/1145a382cd4cf37a59425478f9c62c23651696cf"

target="_blank"> Process: Handle kevent ESRCH errors caused by processes exiting too
fast</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>SC::Build<a href="#section-5-1" id="section-5-1" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h3>
<p>

As already said the <a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_build.html"
target="_blank">SC::Build</a> library got the capability of compiling specific configuration
/ architecture combos.
</p>
<p>
This has been also the occasion to cleanup the intermediates / output folder naming, so that
all folders can coexist in the same working directory.
This is useful to map that very same working directory on all Operating Systems (with a couple
of Virtual Machines), so that code can be quickly tested on all platforms while it's being
developed, before even hitting the CI.
</p>

<p>
Features:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/1f2a8aab363b884bb02432470567d8d7d3fb83bf"

<h3>SC::Async<a href="#section-5-2" id="section-5-2" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_async.html" target="_blank">SC::Async</a>
library got some fixes in the child process exit handling,
that
was randomly failing on the<code>SC-format</code> command!
</p>
<p>
Features:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/996374f9f37542631f3b579e2c34e9327c603df6"
target="_blank">Async: Remove the handle from active list before calling complete
callback</a>

Bugfixes:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/commit/9d94bb85354d45fc0358230d4d7c231107cbf87e"
target="_blank">Async: Handle merged <code>SIGCHLD</code> by signalfd on epoll
backend</a>
<br>
This was causing spuriously missing child process exit notifications, and it was only
visible on Linux (Intel) with a "high enough" number of concurrent process finishing
"simultaneously".
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>SC::FileSystem<a href="#section-5-3" id="section-5-3" class="secondary" tabindex="-1">#</a></h3>

<p>
<a href="https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/library_fileSystem.html"
